## 📖 What is GreenCommute?

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **GreenCommute** — a passion project born from a simple question: *"What if every daily commute could help save the planet?"*

Unlike typical ride-sharing apps that just get you from A to B, GreenCommute is built around **sustainability from the ground up**. It's a carpooling platform that connects everyday commuters heading in the same direction, helping them share rides, split costs, and track exactly how much carbon they're keeping out of the atmosphere.

Think of it as Uber meets environmental activism — but for regular people sharing their daily commute, not professional drivers.

### Why Did I Build This?

Let's face it — our cities have a problem:
- 🚗 **Traffic is insane** — Single-occupancy vehicles clog our roads every morning
- 💨 **Cars pollute A LOT** — The average car emits 4.6 metric tons of CO₂ yearly
- 💸 **Fuel prices keep rising** — And we're all feeling it in our wallets
- 🌡️ **Climate change is real** — And transportation is a huge contributor

### The Solution

GreenCommute makes carpooling actually *fun* and *rewarding*. Share a ride, watch your carbon savings grow, plant virtual trees, climb leaderboards, and compete with friends in eco-challenges. It turns boring commutes into a game where everyone wins — your wallet, your community, and the planet.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm ([install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to project directory
cd eco-commute-collective

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## 🔑 Setting Up Your Own API Keys

**Important:** This project requires your own API keys to work. I've removed my personal keys for security reasons, so you'll need to set up your own (don't worry, it's free!).

### Step 1: Create a `.env` file

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory with the following:

```env
# Google Maps API Keys
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

# Application Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=GreenCommute
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Get Your Google Maps API Key (Free)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Geocoding API
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
5. Copy your key and paste it in the `.env` file

> 💡 **Tip:** Google gives you $200 free credit monthly — that's 28,000+ map loads for free!

### Step 3: Set Up Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project called "GreenCommute" (or any name you like)
3. Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password)
4. Enable **Firestore Database**
5. Go to Project Settings → Your Apps → Add Web App
6. Copy the config and update `src/lib/firebase.ts`:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Step 4: Restart and You're Good to Go!

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The app should now work with your own keys. 🎉
